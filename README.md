# tabular reinforcement learning algo (Q-learning and SARSA)

This project explores the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically Q-learning and SARSA, in a grid-based environment with an added teacher-student framework. The teacher agent provides guidance to the student agent based on configurable parameters such as availability and accuracy. The project evaluates how teacher advice impacts the learning efficiency, success rate, and cumulative rewards of the student agent.

Key features include the use of epsilon-greedy exploration strategies, dynamic reward mechanisms, and comparative analysis of teacher-guided and independent learning. The project incorporates visualizations like reward trajectories and heatmaps to analyze the influence of teacher parameters on learning outcomes. This approach demonstrates the potential of integrating external guidance to improve agent learning in reinforcement learning environments.
